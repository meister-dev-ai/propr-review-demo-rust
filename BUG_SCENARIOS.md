# Bug Scenarios

These feature branches are intentionally defective review targets built from a clean `main` branch.

- `feature/bug_1`: add reading-time metadata but compute it from rendered HTML instead of markdown text
- `feature/bug_2`: add a latest-posts panel but sort posts in ascending date order
- `feature/bug_3`: render formatted article summaries as raw HTML and widen the HTML injection surface
- `feature/bug_4`: add related-post navigation but exclude the current article incorrectly when dates are missing or titles collide
- `feature/bug_5`: make article cards fully clickable using nested interactive elements
- `feature/bug_6`: generate a sitemap but omit article pages from the output
